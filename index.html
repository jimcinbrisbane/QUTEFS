            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The Queensland University of Tecnology Economics Finance Society ( QUTEFS ) is a student run organisation whose goal is to Inform, Inspire and Incorporate its members into the real world. EFS offers you invaluable networking opportunities

            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
            <p>With a proud and distinguished history stretching back to the early years of the new millennium the QUT Economics and Finance Society is truly the premier society on campus for those students passionate about the disciplines of Economics and
                Finance. Our mission statement of EFS outlines three main goals.</p>
            <div id="aboutfst">
                <h3>Inspire</h3>
                <p>Few people know just what economics and finance is; fewer still are aware of the amazing opportunities the field presents. EFS seeks to inspire a love for economics and finance within its members; helping to establish a lifelong passion.</p>

            </div>
            <div id="aboutsnd">

                <h3>Inform</h3>
                <p>You won’t learn everything you need for business in a lecture hall; somethings can only be taught outside the classroom. EFS helps equip its members with critical knowledge needed for business success that the university won’t teach you.
                    Our professional development workshops and industry seminars will teach you the skills needed to succeed in the business world.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="abouttrd">

                <h3>Incorporate</h3>
                <p>They say only 20% of jobs are ever advertised, EFS can help find the jobs that aren’t. By attending EFS networking events members gain the opportunity to liaise with professionals in the field of economics and finance, human-relations
                    personnel and even corporate CEOs. The contacts you make at EFS may not get you a job; but they can certainly help get your foot in the door.</p>
